# TODO list

## Command Line

  * validate args
  * move to https://github.com/mattallty/Caporal.js

## Documentation

  * overview of the commands
  * overview of the outputs

## Features

### Interactive Jirascope

Rather than a command line output, a regularly published site with more information and clickable regions.  Ideas include:

  * clicking on a ticket number opens up the jira details in an iframe (or similar)
  * clicking on an exit node opens up the page for that subgraph

### Outputs / Formatters

Be able to supply a formatter for the output, such as CSV etc.
